# On Anti-Queer Rhetoric

This is a primer for moderators of online chat platforms to understand the basics of anti-queer rhetoric, to more thoroughly combat it without having to resort to heavy handed policies such as banning all speech of specific types (i.e. political speech (What even does "political" mean?))

Your job as an instance moderator isn't to manage a debate, but it is to deliver consequences to those acting in bad faith. This is an attempt to more clearly define what bad faith is.

If one of the participants is *aware* that they are making specious (misleading) arguments, and continues to do so, they are acting in Bad Faith.

## What is politics?

Politics is how we define relations of power within a community, who is allowed to hold power, and the limits and validity of power. Status and resources are typically controlled by wielders of power, so the discussion of politics is relevant to almost all discussions of queerness; who is queer is a political question. Who is oppressed and how are political discussions.

## General Rhetoric

* Colloquial discussion, dissent, conflict, cooperation
* What is the point of an argument?
  * To prove something
  * To win in front of an audience
  * To learn something
* Writing an essay is taught in schools, but it's not generally taught as rhetoric
* Formal rhetoric is not taught in most grade schools, most americans don't get it (if they do) until College. The average american has a 5th grade reading comprehension, and doesn't understand rhetoric.

* Argument, proposition
* Logos, Pathos, Ethos
* Modus Ponens
* Validity and Soundness

* Philosophy 101 - The chair definition
  * Godel's Incompleteness Theorems - Formal Languages Cannot prove themselves
  * Wittgenstein - Limitations of Language
  * Semiotics - Signs and Language

For these reasons, natural languages are known as Open languages; they have a lot of ambiguity to meaning, so they cannot clearly specify meaning, and most arguments are lost immediately because both parties fail to recognize that they haven't defined their terms. The interlocutors can continue to argue, and this would be simple ignorance. Most arguments that fail are in good faith.


### General Failure Modes of Arguments

Good or Bad faith arguments - are people trying to state truth, or are they trying to win?

[Hanlon's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) assumes that most arguments fail to (stupidity) ignorance, rather than malice. As mods, you are watching for the special case of malice.

You are watching for the use of known bad fallacies; when someone argues pathos without acknowledging a logical flaw, it's likely to be bad faith.

#### Typology of bad arguers

* Trolls (Just want an emotional reaction) - The least dangerous
* [Sea lions](https://wondermark.com/c/1062/) Usually just want to be right, probably autists
* Bullshitters - 
* True Believers - The most dangerous, but rarest type

I've found a lot of the time malicious individuals will out themselves when you ask them directly, particularly the sea lions; they want to appear as factually correct as possible, often they're autistic and are bad at lying, so if you ask them directly whether they're acting in good faith, they hesitate and dance away from the question. This won't work on a pathological liar, but bullshitters and pathological liars don't care.



#### Fallacies

* [Thou Shalt Not Commit Logical Fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/)
* [PBS Idea Channel Fallacies Primer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qb-h0sXkH4)
* Ad Hom is the most common
* Strawman > Steelman

* [Gish Gallop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop)
  * "the bullshit asymmetry principle" - Takes longer to refute bad claims than to make them
(https://wp.dailybruin.com/images/2016/11/FreezePeach.ValareeCatangay_copy.jpg)
* Freeze Peach - Deserves special mention Because it's standard Strawman/Gish Gallop Fodder
  * Absolutist speech is Paradoxical - 
* [Paradox of Tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance)


### Quick Science Primer

Arguments about science quickly fall apart because most people don't know how to validate whether a study is sound.

* Methodology
  * IRBs
  * Blind/Double-blind studies
  * 
* P-values
  * Repeatability
  * Sample size
  * Relevance as a model that maps to the population being studied
